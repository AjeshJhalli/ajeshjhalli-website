      <h3 class="mt-5">Professional Background</h3>
      <p>
        With several years of experience in the software industry, I have honed
        my skills in a wide range of technologies and frameworks. My primary
        focus is on web development, where I leverage tools like Next.js, React,
        and Node.js to create seamless, interactive user experiences and robust,
        scalable backend systems. Additionally, I have extensive experience
        integrating systems with Microsoft Azure services, including Azure AD
        B2C and Azure App Services, to enhance security and scalability.
      </p>
      <h3>Programming Languages & Runtimes</h3>
      <p>
        I am most experienced with JavaScript, Python and Claris FileMaker. I have built
        several software systems using JavaScript and Claris FileMaker which have real users.
        I have built Node.js APIs, as well as Next.js websites. I have also built vanilla JS
        FileMaker webviewer components, which has allowed for much more performant and user user-friendly
        interfaces in FileMaker.
      </p>
      <h3>Databases</h3>
      <p>
        One of my standout skills is my expertise in relational databases. I
        have significant experience with Claris FileMaker, which has given me a
        deep understanding of database design and management. I have experience
        working with SQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Cloud Platforms
      </h3>
      <p>
        Many of the applications I have built have used components of Microsoft Azure.
        This includes Entra ID, Cosmos DB, Active Directory B2C, App Services, Azure Tables, Blob Storage,
        Azure Gateway and Azure Functions.
      </p>
      <h3>APIs</h3>
      <p>
        I have used the Xero API to sync invoices and contacts between Xero and custom databases.
        I have used the QuickBooks API in a similar way for companies who use QuickBooks.
