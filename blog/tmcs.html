        <h1>Travel Management Company (TMC) Software Explained</h1>
        <p>
          A TMC (Travel Management Company) is a business that helps
          organizations manage their travel arrangements. TMCs tend to use
          various software tools to streamline the process of booking flights,
          hotels, and other travel services for their clients. I will go through
          some of the most common types of software you will come across when
          working with a TMC.

        <h2>GDS - Global Distribution System</h2>
        <p>
          Arguably the most important software for a TMC is something called a
          GDS (Global Distribution System). It's a software system which lets
          travel agents make bookings for their clients with airlines, hotels,
          car rental companies, and other travel service providers. The main GDS
          systems used today are
          <a href="https://www.amadeus.com/en">Amadeus</a>,
          <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.travelport.com/">Travelport</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several reasons why TMCs usually prefer booking through a
          GDS as opposed to direct with the airlines or hotels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consolidation:</strong> A GDS aggregates inventory from
            multiple service providers, allowing travel agents to search and
            book from a single platform rather than dealing with each provider
            separately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access to negotiated rates:</strong> TMCs often have
            corporate agreements with service providers that offer discounted
            rates not available to the general public. These negotiated rates
            are typically accessible through the GDS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Comprehensive data:</strong> GDS systems provide detailed
            information about availability, pricing, and policies, enabling
            travel agents to make informed decisions for their clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Using a GDS streamlines the booking
            process, saving time for travel agents and allowing them to manage
            multiple bookings more effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On the other hand, there might be reasons for companies to book direct
          instead of through a GDS, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower fees:</strong> Some service providers may offer lower
            fees for direct bookings compared to those made through a GDS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special promotions:</strong> Direct bookings may provide
            access to exclusive promotions or packages not available through a
            GDS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Booking directly with service
            providers can sometimes offer more flexibility in terms of changes
            or cancellations.
          </li>
        </ul>
